# Neural Networks

### Description

This is the repo where I implement a Neural Network from scratch to gain a deeper understaindg of it.
For tricky derivatives/gradients like the softmax one, I rely on given python implementations rather than deriving them myself.

### TO REVIEW AGAIN FOR DEEPER UNDERSTANDING:

- Softmax activation derivative (alone)
- Common Categorical Cross-Entropy loss and Softmax activation derivative
- Performance test. Calculating gradient for cross entropy and softmax separately and then all in one go. (HINT: joint should be around 6 to 8 times faster)
